# Ethereum Improvement Proposal Notes
I've put this off far too long and if your reading this you have too. I finally got sick of putting off sitting down and reading all proposals and taking notes on them (Review/Draft/Stagnant/Withdrawn coming soon). Some of it is word for word but I find typing them out myself helps it stick better. Use to just open them up to reference but no longer. If you find these notes useful good!
